/// The JSON struct holds an arbitrary piece of data. It is designed to be entirely flexible within its own operation, much like javascript data, and dynamic member lookup to simulate arbitrary accessing. It is also generally styled with Swift patterns and protocol support where it makes sense. When using JSON, perform as many operations within its context as possible before extracting it to Swift data. Due to dynamic property support, most operators are defined statically in addition to instanced. For example, `JSON.isTruthy(someJson)` rather than `someJson.isTruthy`. This can help clarify that the intended operation is not to use a JSON property. If a property is masked by a function, it can always be accessed by index as well. For example, `someJson["isTruthy"]` will always access a property in the JSON data itself.

    // The internalValue contains all physical properties of the data.
    internal var internalValue: InternalValue
    
    /// Initializing an empty JSON will create an 'undefined' entry.
    public init() {
        internalValue = .undefined
    }
    
    /// Package shortcut to initialize JSON
    internal init(_ internalValue: InternalValue) {
        self.internalValue = internalValue
    }

    // Undefined is supported in JSON objects, in that it will not write to new JSON structures.
    case undefined
    // Null is supported by writing 'null' into JSON structures.
