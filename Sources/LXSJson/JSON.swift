/// The JSON struct holds an arbitrary piece of data. It is designed to be entirely flexible within its own operation, much like javascript data. When using JSON, perform as many operations within its context as possible before extracting it to Swift data. Due to dynamic property support, most operators are going to be defined statically rather than by instance. For instance, `JSON.isTruthy(someJson)` rather than `someJson.isTruthy`. This allows for the possibility of the JSON data underneath actually allowing the key, isTruthy, to be read as-is instead of requiring certain overrides.

    // The internalType contains all physical properties of the data.
    var internalType: JSONInternalType
    
    /// Initializing an empty JSON will create an 'undefined' entry.
    public init() {
        internalType = .undefined
    }
    
    /// Package shortcut to initialize JSON
    internal init(_ internalType: JSONInternalType) {
        self.internalType = internalType
    }
